# Longest Common Subsequence diff
An implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm in Rust (and some other things, such as file reading and diff algorithm).

This implementation is a resolution of the exersice 2 of the second exersice guide of [Taller de Programación (cátedra Deymonnaz)](https://taller-1-fiuba-rust.github.io/guia_2.html)
